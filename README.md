Since 2010 I've been designing recording studios and other acoustic spaces as an Acoustic Engineer. I started an acoustic design and consulting company, [Audio Virtue Acoustics](https://audiovirtue.com), and later designed, engineered and manufacturered acoustic treatment products that we used in our designs. 

Along the way, I became more and more interested in software and less interested in being invovled in construction projects and manufacturing. I took the Software Engineering course at General Assembly and found that my engineering mindset and business soft skills transitions perfectly into a transition into tech. 

I'm currently in the job market looking for my first full time job in as a Full Stack Software Engineer. In the meantime I'm developing an app called [Haven Nanny App](https://github.com/Haven-Nanny-LLC) for my wife's nanny agency with the same name (Haven Nanny Services) and an app called [Streamflow](https://github.com/zacmarcengill/Streamflow-React-App) that I'll be using to help plan safer and more successful fly fishing trips. You can find the links to both below.
